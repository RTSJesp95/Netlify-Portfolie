                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have worked with programs like Photoshop and have created my own desktop wallpapers with material from the web. I also have experience with Adobe Illustrator and made logos for my projects both in my spare time and in school.
                    Have actually worked quite a bit on videos in both Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere Pro and I feel I have a pretty good understanding on both managing and editing videos (Adding effects, sound effects, smart transitions, etc.).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also have some experience in coding and also designing websites with HTML and CSS. I also know some things about JavaScript and making the page smarter with the things you can do in JavaScript. Like click events, classList.add/remove,if and else statements etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm a good listener, good at understanding if a particular situation arises, very good at keeping appointments and also very good at keeping deadlines. I am always ready to learn some new knowledge and learn more with the knowledge I now have, so that I can become better at the work requirements and tasks that are set at the workplace.

                    <p>I have always had an interest in Graphic Design and designing desktop wallpapers. It forces you to be creative and using your imagination. I have experience working with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. What you see above is a logo I made myself for a school project back in November/December 2018. The same goes for the logo in the header. It's also fun to just sit, think and come up with ideas in your head and make it real.</p>

                    <p>Video Editing is also one of the things I always had an interest in. Even to point where I made a YouTube account and uploaded my own. Although it's been quite since I last uploaded a video to my YouTube Channel. Also just sitting down and making videos with various effects, adding sound effects, zoom in and out on certain parts of the video, adding keyframes for certain actions etc. is part of what makes video editing fun for me. I have worked with programs like Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere Pro</p>

                    <p>Working with coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript hasn't always been my strong suit. But after learning more about it, I have become much better at understanding on how to code a website from scratch. Working with HTML and CSS has become much easier, now that have I good understanding on how they cooperate. JavaScript I still have some trouble understanding, but I still get how a good portion of JavaScript works and how to use it</p>
